Requirements:
	
	    1.	Stop the conveyor when the right edge of the box is first sensed by 
	    	the prox-sensor.
	
	    2.	With the box in position and the conveyor stopped, open the solenoid 
	    	valve and allow the box to fill. Filling should stop when the Level sensor 
	    	goes true.
	
	    3.	The FILL light will be energized while the box is filling.
	
	    4.	The FULL light will energize when the box is full and will 
	    	remain that way until the box has moved clear of the prox-sensor.
	
	    5.	Once the box is full, momentarily pressing the Start Switch will
	    	move the box off the conveyor and bring a new box into position. 
	    	Forcing the operator to hold the Start button down until the box 
	    	clears the prox-sensor is not acceptable.
