Requirements:
	
	    1.	When the selector switch is in position "A", the system shall operate in 
	    	the "Continuous" mode of operation. This is the mode of operation which was used in Exercise #1.
	
	    2.	When the selector switch is in position "B", the system shall operate in 
	    	the "Manual Restart" mode of operation. This is the mode of operation which
	    	was used in Exercise #2.
	
	    3.	When the selector switch is in position "C", the system shall operate in 
	    	the "Fill Bypass" mode of operation. In this mode, the boxes will simply move 
	    	down the conveyor continuously and bypass the fill operation. As in the other 
	    	modes, the Start and Stop pushbuttons will control the conveyor motion and the 
	    	Run Lamp will operate as expected.
